Hello Reader,

This is a project that I created as a challange for people new to js.
If you are looking for the challange, go ahead and clone the script files.
If you are not new to js and you still want to do this go ahead and clone the same files but delete all of the code in the js file.
If you just want to look at this then you will want to look at the index.html and main.js.
If you are doing the challenge where I have made the move function for you, please feel free to read my variables but please do not change the value of any existing code or you risk destroying your program  
If you finish this challange I scinerly hope that you get to feel the amazing feeing that is when you fiish a program.

Signed,
The Author of this Challange
